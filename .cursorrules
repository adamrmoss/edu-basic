# ⚠️ CRITICAL RULES - VERIFY BEFORE EVERY RESPONSE ⚠️

## FORBIDDEN ACTIONS
- ❌ NEVER run shell commands or terminal commands (user has sole discretion)
- ❌ NEVER make code changes without explicit user request
- ❌ NEVER assume work is complete without verification
- ❌ NEVER create generic folders like `controllers/`, `views/`, `services/`
- ❌ NEVER inline comments (always on their own line)
- ❌ NEVER include HTML/SCSS directly in TypeScript components (use separate files)

## REQUIRED ACTIONS
- ✅ ALWAYS answer questions directly BEFORE taking action
- ✅ ALWAYS verify changes by reading the actual file output
- ✅ ALWAYS use standalone Angular components with separate template/stylesheet files
- ✅ ALWAYS use explicit 'this.' in C# code for instance members
- ✅ ALWAYS use braces { } for all control structures in C#, even single-line blocks
- ✅ ALWAYS save executable scripts (SQL, T-SQL, etc.) to appropriately named files

# Problem-Solving Strategy

When solving problems, follow this workflow:

1. **Plan First**: Understand the problem, read examples, identify patterns
2. **Test Manually**: Use search_replace on ONE example to verify the approach works
3. **Apply Systematically**: Use grep to find patterns, then fix iteratively with search_replace
4. **Only Script When Necessary**: Use scripts only for complex logic that cannot be done with search_replace
5. **Verify Work**: Always read the actual file output to confirm changes worked
6. **Never Be Overconfident**: Don't claim completion without verification

**Avoid running scripts as a first solution** - prefer manual search_replace operations.

# Communication & Workflow

- When user says they already fixed something, acknowledge it and move on (don't offer to fix it again)
- Add comments only for documenting the codebase, not for conveying info to the developer (use chat for that)
- Save all standalone executable code (SQL scripts, etc.) to files instead of only displaying in chat

# Technology-Specific Rules

## Angular
- Use standalone components with separate files for templates (.html) and stylesheets (.scss)
- Prefer TypeScript over JavaScript
- Prefer SCSS over CSS

## C# Code Style
- Use explicit 'this.' to reference instance members (methods and properties)
- Use braces { } for all control structures, even single-line blocks
- Add line breaks between logical groups of code for readability
- Keep each logical operation visually separate

## TypeScript/JavaScript Code Style
- Prefer switch statements over else-if chains when checking the same variable
- Use braces { } for all control structures, even single-line blocks

## Architecture
- Divide solutions by layers into projects
- Subdivide projects semantically in domain space
- Organize by domain concepts, NOT by technical layers
